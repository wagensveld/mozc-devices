### PCBs

We need two types of PCBs to build this project.

![pcbs](./images/pcbs.jpg)

#### Key-PCB

![key-pcb](./images/key-pcb.png)

File location: board/key

Shape: Rectangular.

Components: Diodes and key switches.

Number of PCBs required: 12

Thickness: 1.6mm

#### Base-PCB:

![base-pcb](./images/base-pcb.png)

File location: board/base

Shape: Dodecagonal

Component2: ATMega32u4.

Number of PCBs required: 1

Thickness: 1.6mm

### Steps to build

#### Step 1

Solder diodes D1 to D5 onto the twelve Key-PCBs at the silk-screened locations.

*IMPORTANT:* Diodes on six of the Key-PCB should be placed in the opposite
direction.

For six of the PCBs, we can solder diodes as indicated by the silk-screen. For
the other six PCBs, we need to solder the diodes in the opposite direction.

#### Step 2

Solder key-switches to each Key-PCB. Note that the diodes need to be placed on
the opposite side of the Key-PCB to the key-switches, as shown by the
silk-screen.

#### Step 3

Create a cylindrical shape by combining the 12 Key-PCBs.

There are six connection points between each pair of Key-PCBs. Connect adjacent
pairs of boards by soldering the tin-plated wires (see the picture).

However, only connect J11 and J12 between the first and last Key-PCB, instead of
all six locations.

If you have a 3D printer, you may print and use jig.stl to help with this step.

#### Step 4

Solder all parts for Base-PCB.

#### Step 5

Connect Base-PCB to the cylinder made in Step 3.

#### Step 6

Install the
[Arduino caterina bootloader](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-avr/blob/master/bootloaders/caterina/Caterina-Leonardo.hex)
using AVRISP or other ISP tool.

#### Step 7

Install firmware using the Arduino IDE.

#### Step 8

Connect the keyboard to a PC or other device that has Google Japanese
Input/Gboard installed.
