### PCBs

We need two types of PCBs to build this project.

File location: board/key

Shape: Rectangular

Components to be soldered: Diodes and key switches

Number of PCBs required: 12

Thickness: 1.6mm

#### Base-PCB:

File location: board/base-promicro

Shape: Dodecagonal

Components to be soldered: Pro Micro

Number of PCBs required: 1

Thickness: 1.6mm

### Steps to build

#### Step 1

Solder diodes D1 to D5 onto the twelve Key-PCBs at the silk-screened locations.

*IMPORTANT:* Diodes on six of the Key-PCBs should be placed in the opposite
direction.

In other words, you can solder diodes as indicated by the silk-screen for six of them, and you need to solder diodes in the opposite direction for the rest six.

#### Step 2

Solder key-switches to each Key-PCB. Note that the diodes need to be placed on
the opposite side of the Key-PCB to the key-switches, as shown by the
silk-screen.

#### Step 3

Create a cylindrical shape by combining the 12 Key-PCBs.

There are six connection points between each pair of Key-PCBs. Connect adjacent
pairs of boards by soldering the tin-plated wires (see the picture).

However, only connect J11 and J12 between the first and last Key-PCB, instead of
all six locations.

If you have a 3D printer, you may print and use jig.stl to help with this step.

#### Step 4

Solder a Pro Micro to the Base-PCB.

#### Step 5

Connect Base-PCB to the cylinder made in Step 3.

#### Step 6

Install [firmware](./firmware/firmware.ino) using the Arduino IDE. Note that you need to uncomment the line 2 (`#define PRO_MICRO`) to make it work with the Pro Micro version.

#### Step 7 (Optional)

Print and mount the platform (./platform_promicro.stl).

#### Step 8

Connect the keyboard to a PC or other device that has Google Japanese
Input/Gboard installed. Enjoy!
